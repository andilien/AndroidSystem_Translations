Yo guys, once the translation is at 100% send me a mail if you want the apk of the pro for test the translations etc.
P.S keep in mind that after each update i'll update the strings that contains the new updates. So please keep an eye sometimes if there are new string that need translations.
Also, send me a mail every time i update the app for send the apk of the pro!

A fast way to translate:
- Open the strings.xml, arrays.xml and store description files.
- Copy paste the content of the 3 files and create a local copy on your pc
- Translate them one by one and submit!

Check check check!
If you (example) are from french and you see that there is already a translation of the file, you can open it in github and check
if there are any errors inside! you can submit in any time pull requests to fix them!
