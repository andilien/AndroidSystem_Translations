Yo guys, once the translation is at 100% send me a mail if you want the apk of the pro for test the translations etc.
P.S keep in mind that after each update i'll update the strings that contains the new updates. So please keep an eye sometimes if there are new string that need translations.
Also, send me a mail every time i update the app for send the apk of the pro!

A fast way to translate:
- Fork the repository to your account
- Always remember to sync with my last changes
- Make your changes
- Send the pull request

Another way for non git familiar users
- On the right side of the window click on download zip
- Extract the zip that include all files
- Delete all directories except the original english
- Rename the original english folder into the lang you are translating
- Use notepad++ and open the 3 files
- Start translating, once finished, submit to giovanni.rocca.90@gmail.com

REMEMBER!
- I'll keep the strings up-to-date here, so before making a pull request or start translations, sync my changes!
